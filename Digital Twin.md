# Digital Twin

## Definition
The actual definition of the Digital Twin has never been clear, and the ever-growing number of publications in the last few years has only added to the diversity of DT meanings. However, that the Digital Twinimplementation attempts so far seem to have been accomplished with the support of a number of common enabling
technologies, such as: Machine Learning, Transfer Learning, distributed computing (i.e., cloud, fog, and edge computing), the (Industrial) Internet of Things (I/IoT), Cyber-Physical System, and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality [22].

In this paper, Digital Twin is described as a self-adapting, self-regulating, self-monitoring, and self-diagnosing system-of-systems with the following properties: 
* It is characterized by a symbiotic relationship between a physical entity and its virtual representation
* Its fidelity, rate of synchronization, and choice of enabling technologies are tailored to its envisioned use cases
* It supports services that add operational and business value to the physical entity

The explanation of the description are below:
*  Self-adapting - a DT automatically reacts to changes in its real twin’s environment and configuration, but it should do so in a way that continually ensures operational excellence (i.e., as measured via use case-appropriate performance measures).
* Self-regulating - the changes a DT undergoes while adapting to its real twin’s environment should not exceed the physical twin’s own limitations for the sake of maximising its performance measures (e.g., productivity, throughput, etc.).
* Self-monitoring - the DT is always aware of its real twin’s environment and configuration, by means of monitoring the parameters that are relevant to its use cases.
* Self-diagnosing - the DT should be able to assess its own health and know, based on its current and historical conditions, when and why it is no longer able to maintain optimal operations

## Digital Twin Enabling Technologies
### Machine Learning
One of the advantages of DT is that it brings awareness (or intelligence, or understanding) to a physical asset that would otherwise lack it. The "awareness" referred to is a new kind of specialized intelligence that is able to understand significant amounts of numerical data and draw domain-specific conclusions from it faster than a human expert could. Thus, the DT should be able to infer meaningful and actionable information from the data that is generated by its physical twin and its environment. In this scenario, ML techniques represent the foundation, or the brain, of a DT. Since ML algorithms are ultimately used to solve optimization problems, one common approach is to employ data-driven models to minimise or maximise a given process parameter, through different ML algorithms, such as Deep Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, etc. 

Besides objective function optimisation, another application of ML within DTs is to make predictions about the future behaviour of the physical asset. In this context, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used in DT to make the prediction. However, ML models, and in particular DL methods, are generally perceived as black-boxes. This is because they do not offer sufficient transparency into what is motivating their predictions. On the other hand, in DT applications, transparency is desirable, and often required. Thus, researchers have looked for ways of integrating both physics-based and data-driven models into the DT

### Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing
DT can be used to mirror complex systems. The virtualisation of composite heterogeneous machines or services always requires heavy computational power. This demand, coupled with the DT’s characteristic of real-virtual synchronisation, often calling for almost real-time responsiveness, illuminates a need for distributed and parallel computing. For this purpose and many others, cloud, fog, and edge computing are frequently encountered in DT-related literature. The unison of cloud computing and DT creates a prosperous environment for complex simulations, multi-variable analysis, DL-based analytics, and Big Data storage. In this type of system, the cloud platform acts as the data warehouse and also provides heavy-processing capabilities, while the DT deals with synchronising the physical and virtual assets.


###  Internet of Things
DT is recognized as a system formed by three functional blocks: the physical asset, its virtual counterpart, and the communication medium that binds them together. Any DT proposal that misses or does not envision the inclusion of any one of these three components is therefore not a real DT. In this context, the Internet of Things and the Industrial Internet of Things are the main enabling technologies that can perfectly fit in-between the digital and real twins to converge virtuality and reality. IoTs have the ability to aggregate data from multiple heterogeneous data sources via disparate communication mediums to facilitate data mining and alaytics through distributed computing frameworks.

The main appeal of these technologies is represented by the IIoT devices that are useful and cheap data sources which can paint meaningful virtual reflections of reality that the cloud-based DT can interpret and analyse. Furthermore, while the IoT is a powerful enabling technology of the DT, the DT itself can also act as a supporting pillar for the IoT by providing a self-adaptive and self-integrating digital abstraction of the IoT devices to make the IoT framework resilient to dynamic changes or by allowing virtual simulations of large sensor networks.


## Use Cases in Towards 5G/6G
Digital transformation across various industries will enable applications that serve different purposes. However, they all have something in common: dependency on reliable and strong connectivity enabled by the underlying next generation network infrastructure (e.g., 5G/6G). Even in the DT technology, the connection of components and devices is of utmost importance and communication latency is expected to be less than a few milliseconds. In this context, the relationship between 5G/6G and DT can be seen from two different point of views. The first one, sees the 5G/6G network as an enabler for different DT applications, while the second one sees the DT as an enabler for 5G/6G by looking at the DT of the network itself. 

With the rapid advancements in smart technologies and applications like holographic projection, VR, AR as well as mission critical applications like remote surgery, that have strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, current networks including 5G will no longer be able to meet these expectations. Although the deployment of 5G networks is not yet completed at a large scale, many industry pioneers and technology leaders are looking ahead at defining the next generation networks, 6G. 6G envisions interactions between three worlds: the human world (e.g., senses, bodies, intelligence, etc.), the digital world (information, communication, computing, etc.); and the physical world (objects, organisms, processes, etc.)

DT has great potential to provide for a digital environment where future generation networks like 6G can evolve. Integrating DT within mobile networks is gaining popularity in the industry from major tech companies like Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia. In this context, DT has the capability to continuously monitor and analyze the performance of the network, predict any unanticipated failures and optimize the network performance by triggering intelligent decisions accordingly. The Figure illustrates a vision of the 6G DT that facilitates the live virtual replica of the whole or parts of the 6G network to perform continuous monitoring and assessment through a closed loop process between the physical entities and the digital counterparts. The 6G DT powered by AI will enable design and performance improvements and real time optimized operations enforced on the physical 6G network
